These errors can be considered suspicious as they may indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system using invalid or stolen credentials. The repeated failure attempts suggest a brute force attack or a credential stuffing attack. The MITRE ATTandCK tactics and techniques that could apply to these log messages are: 1. Tactic: Initial Access - Technique: Brute Force (T1110) - Technique: Credential Stuffing (T1550.002) 2. Tactic: Credential Access - Technique: Kerberos Authentication (T1113) Resolutions for these issues would include: 1. Change all passwords for affected user accounts and implement strong, complex password policies. 2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security. 3. Implement rate limiting or CAPTCHA on login pages to prevent brute force attacks. 4. Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and block IP addresses that exhibit malicious behavior. 5. Regularly review and update system configurations, including firewalls and access control lists (ACLs). 6. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to monitor for and alert on potential attacks. 7. Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and the risks associated with using weak or stolen credentials.","prompt":"[INST] Are there any errors or suspicious activity in the log messages found?
