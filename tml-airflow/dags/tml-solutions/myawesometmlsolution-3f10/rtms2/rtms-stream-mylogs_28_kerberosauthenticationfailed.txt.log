These errors could potentially indicate a brute force attack or an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system using stolen or weak credentials. The repeated failed attempts suggest that an attacker is persistently trying to penetrate the system.The following are some recommended actions to address these issues:1. Change all passwords for affected user accounts and implement strong password policies.2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical systems and applications.3. Review and update access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive resources.4. Implement rate limiting or throttling on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.5. Configure firewalls to block traffic from the IP address 163.27.187.39, unless it is known to be a trusted source.6. Review and update system logs regularly for any suspicious activity.As for MITRE ATTandCK tactic and technique classification:The log messages indicate the following tactics and techniques based on the MITRE ATTandCK framework:1. Initial Access: - Technique ID: Brute Force (T1110) - The repeated failed login attempts suggest a brute force attack to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.2. Credential Access: - Technique ID: Credential Dumping (T1003) or Credential Harvesting (T1007) - The attacker may have obtained the credentials through dumping or harvesting methods and is attempting to use them for unauthorized access.3. Authentication: - Technique ID: Kerberos Authentication (T1118) - The log messages indicate multiple failed Kerberos authentication attempts, suggesting that this technique is being used by the attacker.4. Privilege Escalation: - Technique ID: Exploit Public Facing Application (T1203) - The attacker may be exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly facing application to gain elevated privileges and perform unauthorized actions on the system.It is important to note that these classifications are based on the information provided in the log messages alone, and further investigation may be required to determine the exact nature of the attack and the extent of any damage caused.","prompt":"[INST] Are there any errors or suspicious activity in the log messages found?
