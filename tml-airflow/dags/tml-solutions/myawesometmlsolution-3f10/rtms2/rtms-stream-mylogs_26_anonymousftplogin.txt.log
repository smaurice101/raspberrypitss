Anonymous FTP is a legacy and insecure method for accessing files over the internet without requiring a username or password. It is vulnerable to various attacks, such as directory traversal, file inclusion, and unauthorized access. The repeated attempts from the same IP address could indicate a potential brute-force attack or an attempt to exploit the vulnerability of anonymous FTP. The search term \"anonymous ftp login\" in the log messages suggests that the attacker is specifically targeting this vulnerability. As for resolutions, it is recommended to disable anonymous FTP access entirely and implement secure authentication methods instead. Additionally, updating software and systems regularly can help mitigate known vulnerabilities.
