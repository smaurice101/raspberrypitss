Multiple failed SSH authentication attempts from different IP addresses with invalid credentials or too many login attempts. This could indicate a brute force attack where an attacker is trying to guess valid usernames and passwords. The following log entries are of concern: - sshd24410: pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure (invalid disconnect) logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=invalid ruser= rhost=ec2-52-80-34-196.cn-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com.cn Dec 10 - using search term: invalid disconnect. - sshd24421: Failed password for invalid user admin from 185.190.58.151 - using search term: invalid disconnect. - authentication failure logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=192.168.5.13 user=root too many login attempts Dec 10 10:55:05 LabSZ.2. The log messages also indicate the presence of a Windows Update Agent session with an invalid disconnect and unknown device. While this could be a legitimate activity, it's worth investigating further to ensure that it is not related to any unauthorized access or malware infection.

Brute Force: - Tactic: Initial Access (Technique: Brute Force) - Tactic: Credential Access (Technique: Brute Force)2. Lateral Movement: - Tactic: Command and Control (Technique: Data Encrypted for Exfiltration)3. Persistence: - Tactic: Persistence (Technique: Remote Services)Resolution:To mitigate the risk of a brute force attack, it is recommended to implement strong password policies and enable multi-factor authentication where possible. It's also important to monitor for failed login attempts and limit the number of retries before locking out accounts. In addition, it's essential to keep all systems and software up-to-date to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.To investigate further, you may want to:- Review network traffic logs for any unusual activity from the IP addresses attempting the SSH authentication.- Check system logs for any other failed login attempts or signs of intrusion.- Investigate the Windows Update Agent session and determine if it's related to any unauthorized access or malware infection.- Implement additional security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection software.","prompt":"[INST] Are there any errors or suspicious activity in the log messages found?
