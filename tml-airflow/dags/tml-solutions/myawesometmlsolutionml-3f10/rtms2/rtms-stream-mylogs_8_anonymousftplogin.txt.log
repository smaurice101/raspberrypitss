of \"ANONYMOUS FTP LOGIN\" attempts from the IP address 84.102.20.2 by an anonymous user. Anonymous FTP is a known vulnerability as it allows unauthenticated users to access files on the server using the \"anonymous\" username with no password required. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.The log messages do not indicate any successful logins, but the repeated attempts are still a cause for concern and should be investigated further. It is recommended to:1. Block or restrict anonymous FTP access on your server if it's not necessary.2. Implement strong authentication methods such as username/password or two-factor authentication for FTP access.3. Monitor your logs regularly for any suspicious activity and set up alerts for anomalous behavior.4. Update your FTP software to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches.5. Consider implementing a firewall rule to block or limit traffic from the IP address 84.102.20.2 if it's not a trusted source.As for MITRE ATTandCK classification, these log messages can be classified under the following tactics and techniques:- Tactic: Initial Access - Technique: Brute Force (T1103): Anonymous FTP login attempts with no password or weak passwords can be considered a brute force attack.- Tactic: Command and Control - Technique: External Remote Services (T1076): The attacker is attempting to access the server remotely using FTP as an external service.- Tactic: Defense Evasion - Technique: Data Obfuscation (T1585): Anonymous login attempts can be considered obfuscated as they do not require a clear text password.","prompt":"[INST] Are there any errors or suspicious activity in the log messages found?
